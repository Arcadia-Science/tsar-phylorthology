# tsar_phylorthology
This repository contains scripts and other information that pertains to publication of the `PhylOrthology` workflow and its application to TSAR Eukaryotes.

Three datasets and their corresponding nextflow samplesheets and parameterfiles are included herein. 
**1) `tsar-final`:** This includes the full, filtered proteomes of 35 species of TSAR eukaryotes.
**2) `tsar-test`:** A reduced dataset of the complete, filtered proteomes of 6 species, with at least one representative from Telonemia, Stramenopiles, Alveolata, and Rhizaria. 
**3) `tsar-downsamp-test`:** The same 6 species as in `tsar-test`, but including only 5% of randomly sampled protein sequences. This dataset mat be used to ensure the workflow runs properly on your system.
